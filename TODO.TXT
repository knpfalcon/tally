TILE SHEET
----------
Make the tile selection differ from the tile type. I don't want a tile
coordinate in the tile data (t_map_pos).

Possible fixes. Make an array of tile bitmaps eg. ALLEGRO_BITMAP *tiles[256]
and then use a temporary bitmap to store each tile in a slot. That way I can
refer to the tiles by index, but load them from a 256x256 pixel bitmap.
