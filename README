Tally Trauma
------------

This is something I've been working on and haven't had time to
really do much else on it. Maybe I'm just bored with the project.
Anyway, I'm making the source code public.

It's an EGA-Styled retro platformer. Programmed in C with Allegro 5.

Please read the MIT license. All the art, music, and sound is made and owned 
by me, but if you wish to use it, or decide to do anything with the source, 
just give me some credit somewhere. And feel free to show me what you did,
I'd love to see it. 

I studied some code by Johan Pietz from Alex the Allegator 4, and I 
borrowed some concepts from that. It is noted as comments in the 
source files where appropriate.

I'm not liable for what this may do to you or anyone else's computer. So
don't blame me if things go awry! ;)
