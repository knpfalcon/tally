Tally Trauma
------------

This is something I've been working on and haven't had time to
really do much else on it. Maybe I'm just bored with the project.
Anyway, I'm making the source code public.

It's an EGA-Styled retro platformer. Programmed in C with Allegro 5.

Please read the MIT license. All the art, music, and sound is made and owned 
by me, but if you wish to use it, or decide to do anything with the source, 
just give me some credit somewhere. And feel free to show me what you did,
I'd love to see it. 

I studied some code by Johan Pietz from Alex the Allegator 4, and I 
borrowed some concepts from that. It is noted as comments in the 
source files where appropriate.

I'm not liable for what this may do to you or anyone else's computer. So
don't blame me if things go awry! ;)

UPDATE 10-31-2019
-----------------
I've switched my main OS to Debian Buster because of REASONS, 
and I've finally successfully compiled this in linux. 

It has to be compiled in 32-bit.

These are instructions for Debian Buster (10.1)

*In a terminal do the following
dpkg --add-architecture i386
apt update

*Use apt 
sudo apt liballegro5-dev:i386
sudo apt liballegro5.2:i386

*In the terminal set the environment variable below
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/pkgconfig

*Clone the git repo
git clone https://github.com/knpfalcon/tally.git

*CD to where you cloned the repo

*Compile with the long-ass command below (I didn't feel like making a makefile)
gcc jt_util.c tt_main.c tt_collision.c tt_items.c tt_map.c tt_player.c -o bin/tally $(pkg-config allegro-5 allegro_font-5 allegro_acodec-5 allegro_audio-5 allegro_color-5 allegro_dialog-5 allegro_image-5 allegro_main-5 allegro_memfile-5 allegro_primitives-5  --libs --cflags) -m32

-OR-

Simply use the shell script provided like so: ./com.sh

*CD to bin

*type ./tally

Excuse the mess
---------------
Sorry for all the mess... I'm working on maintaining this a little better.
I'm not a very organized person, and I work too fast for my own good.
