Tally Trauma
============

</p>

This is something I've been working on off-and-on for the last year. It slowly grows, and I
mainly use it as a project to experiment with. It's far from finished, but maybe someday it will be.

It's an EGA-Styled retro platformer. Programmed in C with Allegro 5.

Please read the MIT license. All the art, music, and sound is made and owned 
by me, but if you wish to use it, or decide to do anything with the source, 
just give me some credit somewhere. And feel free to show me what you did,
I'd love to see it. 

I studied some code by Johan Pietz from Alex the Allegator 4, and I 
borrowed some concepts from that. It is noted as comments in the 
source files where appropriate.

**Warning**
This game is far from finished, and the editor has many errors.

I'm not liable for what this may do to your or anyone else's computer. So
don't blame me if things go awry! ;)

Testing and experiments with OPL3 emulation uses the libADLMIDI library.
My code is a mess, but I finally figured out how to feed it into Allegro's audio stream.
I'm using an IMF song I composed in midi format, then fed it through IMF Creator by Adam Biser.
(Only the music uses libADLMIDI, Sound effects are 8-bit wavs.)

Please follow the link to see how to compile it. The libADLMIDI is licensed in parts,
LGPL 2.1+, GPL v2+, GPL v3+, and MIT. And is coded by Vitaly Novichkov (Wohlstand).

Linux
-----------------
I've switched my main OS to Debian Buster because of REASONS, 
and I've finally successfully compiled this in linux. 

It has to be compiled in 32-bit for now because of pointer sizes
in the map data.

These are instructions for **Debian Buster (10.1)**

In a terminal do the following
    
    dpkg --add-architecture i386
    apt update

Install the 32-bit Allegro libraries
    
    sudo apt install liballegro5-dev:i386 liballegro5.2:i386

Clone and Compile libADLMIDI at

	https://github.com/Wohlstand/libADLMIDI

Make sure you have multilib GCC installed
    
    sudo apt install g++-multilib gcc-multilib libc6-dev-i386

In the terminal set the environment variable below
    
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/pkgconfig

Clone the git repo

    git clone https://github.com/knpfalcon/tally.git
    cd tally

Compile the editor and the game
    
    make
    cd bin

To run the game
    
    ./tally

To run the editor
    
    ./tedit


Excuse the mess
---------------
Sorry for all the mess... I'm working on maintaining this a little better.
I'm not a very organized person, and I work too fast for my own good.
